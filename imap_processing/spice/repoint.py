def get_repoint_data() -> pd.DataFrame:
    """
    Read repointing file using environment variable and return as dataframe.

    Pointing and repointing nomenclature can be confusing. In this case,
    repoint is taken to mean a repoint maneuver. Thus, repoint_start and repoint_end
    are the times that bound when the spacecraft is performing a repointing maneuver.
    This is different from a pointing which is the time between repointing maneuvers.

    REPOINT_DATA_FILEPATH environment variable should point to a local
    file where the repointing csv file is located.

    Returns
    -------
    repoint_df : pd.DataFrame
        The repointing csv loaded into a pandas dataframe. The dataframe will
        contain the following columns:
            - `repoint_start_sec`: Starting MET seconds of repoint maneuver.
            - `repoint_start_subsec`: Starting MET milliseconds of repoint maneuver.
            - `repoint_start_met`: Floating point MET of repoint maneuver start time.
            Derived by combining `repoint_start_sec` and `repoint_start_subsec`.
            - `repoint_end_sec`: Ending MET seconds of repoint maneuver.
            - `repoint_end_subsec`: Ending MET milliseconds of repoint maneuver.
            - `repoint_end_met`: Floating point MET of repoint maneuver end time.
            Derived by combining `repoint_end_sec` and `repoint_end_subsec`.
            - `repoint_id`: Unique ID number of each repoint maneuver.

def interpolate_repoint_data(
    query_met_times: Union[float, npt.NDArray],
) -> pd.DataFrame:
    """
    Interpolate repointing data to the queried MET times.

    In addition to the repoint start, end, and id values that come directly from
    the universal repointing table, a column is added to the output dataframe
    which indicates whether each query met time occurs during a repoint maneuver
    i.e. between the repoint start and end times of a row in the repointing
    table.

    Query times that are more than 24-hours after that last repoint start time
    in the repoint table will cause an error to be raised. The assumption here
    is that we shouldn't be processing data that occurs that close to the next
    expected repoint start time before getting an updated repoint table.

    Parameters
    ----------
    query_met_times : float or np.ndarray
        Query times in Mission Elapsed Time (MET).

    Returns
    -------
    repoint_df : pandas.DataFrame
        Repoint table data interpolated such that there is one row
        for each of the queried MET times. Output columns are:
            - `repoint_start_sec`
            - `repoint_start_subsec`
