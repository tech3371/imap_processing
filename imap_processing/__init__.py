"""Interstellar Mapping and Acceleration Probe (IMAP) data processing package.

This package contains the IMAP data processing software. The package is
organized into submodules for each instrument. Each instrument submodule
contains code for each processing level.

There are utilities to read and write IMAP data files in
the CDF file format, and to interact with the SPICE toolkit.
